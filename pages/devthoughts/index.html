          <p>Web Design is one of those subjects I really enjoyed when it came to my first year in university, it has the blend of technicality and designability that scratches an itch within my brain. Despite the difficulties of figuring out how certain things work when it comes to designing, animating, and formatting a webpage, the end result always reminds me that “I made this webpage”. Knowing that these pages that you are seeing right now is made by a student with only 3-4 months of experience, I wonder how better my future projects would be if I keep learning web development past this last semester of the year. If there is something that I would recommend despite it being tough to understand at first, it would be things like art, music, and web development where the end results can be compared to those of your past work. I thoroughly enjoyed this subject despite how I failed to apply some of the concepts taught to me and this webpage will serve as a reminder of where it began when I look back 10 years from now.</p>
